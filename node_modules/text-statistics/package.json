Documentation incoming!\nI removed a lot of the original comments during the port, but seeing as the API remained largely the same, I'll add them in shortly.\n\nSame goes for a test suite - I'll get something working in node in a bit. :)\n\n## Installation\n\nRun this in the browser using a simple `<script>` include - or you can install for node with `npm install text-statistics`.",
